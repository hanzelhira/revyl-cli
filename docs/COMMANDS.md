## Authentication

```bash
revyl auth login     # Authenticate with Revyl
revyl auth logout    # Remove stored credentials
revyl auth status    # Show authentication status
```

## Project Setup (Onboarding Wizard)

```bash
revyl init                                    # Interactive 6-step guided wizard
revyl init -y                                 # Non-interactive: create config and exit
revyl init --provider expo                    # Force Expo as hot reload provider
revyl init --project ID                       # Link to existing Revyl project
revyl init --detect                           # Re-run build system detection
revyl init --force                            # Overwrite existing configuration
revyl init --hotreload-app-scheme myapp       # Override hotreload.providers.expo.app_scheme
revyl init --xcode-scheme ios-dev=MyAppDev    # Override Xcode scheme by build platform key (repeatable)
```

Running `revyl init` without flags launches an interactive wizard that walks you through the full setup:

1. **Project Setup** -- auto-detects your build system (Gradle, Xcode, Expo, Flutter, React Native), creates `.revyl/` directory and `config.yaml`
2. **Authentication** -- checks for existing credentials; if missing, opens browser-based login
3. **Create Apps** -- for Expo, automatically creates/links separate app streams per build key (e.g. `ios-dev`, `ios-ci`, `android-dev`, `android-ci`); for other stacks, select existing apps or create new ones
4. **Dev Loop** -- detects/configures live reload provider for `revyl dev` and maps `platform_keys` to dev streams
5. **First Build** -- for Expo, defaults to one fast dev-stream upload (`ios-dev` on macOS, `android-dev` elsewhere), with easy options for Android-only or parallel both; failures can be retried or deferred without restarting
6. **Create First Test** -- creates a test; if the name already exists, offers to link, rename, or skip; auto-syncs YAML to `.revyl/tests/`

Use `-y` to skip the interactive steps and just generate the config file.

During the interactive flow, you can also choose **Skip build setup for now**.
Revyl keeps the detected platform keys as placeholders in `.revyl/config.yaml`,
but clears the build command and artifact path until you are ready to finish
native build setup later.

## Project Config

View and edit local project settings stored in `.revyl/config.yaml`.

```bash
revyl config path                                 # Print path to the config file
revyl config show                                 # Show current project settings
revyl config show --json                          # JSON for scripting
revyl config edit                                 # Open in $EDITOR / $VISUAL / vi
revyl config set open-browser false               # Toggle auto-open behavior
revyl config set timeout 900                      # Default CLI/device timeout (seconds)
revyl config set hotreload.provider expo          # Active hot reload provider
revyl config set hotreload.app-scheme myapp       # Deep link scheme for Expo
revyl config set hotreload.port 8081              # Dev server port
revyl config set hotreload.use-exp-prefix true    # Expo-specific deep link behavior
```

Supported `set` keys: `open-browser`, `timeout`, `hotreload.provider`, `hotreload.app-scheme`, `hotreload.port`, `hotreload.use-exp-prefix`.

## Running Tests

```bash
revyl test run login-flow                 # Run against last uploaded build
revyl test run login-flow --build         # Build, upload, then run
revyl test run login-flow --build --platform release   # Use a specific platform config

revyl workflow run smoke-tests            # Run a workflow
revyl workflow run smoke-tests --build    # Build then run workflow
```

### Advanced Run Flags

```bash
--retries 3       # Retry on failure (1-5, default 1)
--build-id <id>   # Run against a specific build version
--no-wait         # Queue and exit without waiting for results
--verbose / -v    # Show step-by-step execution progress
--timeout 3600    # Max execution time in seconds
```

## Dev Loop

`revyl dev` starts a local development loop backed by a cloud device session. Both **Expo** and **bare React Native** projects are supported, plus native Swift/iOS and Android projects via rebuild-based loops.

Each `revyl dev` invocation creates a **dev context** -- a named, worktree-local dev loop bound to one runtime platform. Use `--context` for same-repo concurrency; separate worktrees use the default context automatically.

```bash
revyl dev                              # Start hot reload + live device (defaults to iOS)
revyl dev --platform android           # Explicit platform
revyl dev --context ios-main           # Named context for parallel loops
revyl dev --no-open                    # SSH/headless: keep device running but don't open browser
revyl dev --platform ios --build       # Force a fresh dev build before start
revyl dev --app-id <app-id>            # Use explicit app override
revyl dev --build-version-id <id>      # Use explicit build override
revyl dev --platform-key ios-dev       # Use explicit platform key
revyl dev --force-hot-reload           # Diagnostic launch after Expo relay transport
revyl dev --no-build --tunnel "<expo-dev-client-link>"  # Use an existing Expo tunnel/deep link
```

`revyl dev`:
- starts your local dev server (Expo via `npx expo start --dev-client`, or Metro via `npx react-native start`)
- creates a Revyl relay to expose it to cloud devices
- resolves the latest build for your current git branch from your dev app mapping (`hotreload.providers.<provider>.platform_keys`), then installs it
  - if no branch-matching build exists, it falls back to the latest available build and prints a warning
- opens a cloud device session wired to the deep link

Normal `revyl dev` runs suppress advisory HMR diagnostics. Use `revyl dev --debug`
when you specifically need relay/HMR troubleshooting output. In cloud-agent
environments, keep the Revyl relay running after `Dev loop ready` and use device
screenshots or `revyl device report --session-id <id> --json` as source of truth
before switching to an external Expo tunnel.
For Expo manifest readiness timeouts, use `--force-hot-reload` as the first
diagnostic path. Revyl still starts Expo and verifies relay transport; the flag
skips only the manifest and bundle proof so the device can be the source of
truth. If the app loads, keep working. If the dev client shows a project load
error, restart Expo/Metro or capture a session report with
`revyl device report --session-id <id> --json`.

For externally managed Expo tunnels, start Expo yourself and pass either the
full dev-client link Expo prints or the raw `https://...` tunnel URL:

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel --dev-client
revyl dev --no-build --app-id <app-id> --tunnel "<deep-link-from-expo>"
```

When you pass the full Expo dev-client link, `revyl dev` uses that link directly
and does not require `hotreload.providers.expo.app_scheme` in `.revyl/config.yaml`.

After the dev loop is running, use `revyl device` commands to interact:
```bash
revyl device screenshot
revyl device tap --target "Login button"
revyl device instruction "verify the dashboard loads"
```

### Device-first flow

Start a plain device session first, then attach and run the dev loop on it:

```bash
revyl device start --platform ios
revyl dev attach active                # or: revyl dev attach <session-id>
revyl dev                              # reuses the attached session
```

When a context has an attached session, `revyl dev --context <name>` reuses
it instead of provisioning a new device. Attached sessions are left running
when the dev loop exits -- use `revyl device stop` to end them.

### Context management

```bash
revyl dev list                         # List dev contexts in the current worktree
revyl dev use ios-main                 # Switch the current context
revyl dev status                       # Show context status (JSON)
revyl dev rebuild                      # Trigger a rebuild
revyl dev stop                         # Stop the current context
revyl dev stop --all                   # Stop all contexts
```

### Hot reload providers

Expo deep-links into a dev client via `app_scheme`; bare React Native loads the JS bundle directly over the Revyl→Metro relay. For provider config schema and the full per-framework setup walkthrough, see [Configuration › Hot Reload](CONFIGURATION.md#hot-reload-configuration) and the [Dev Setup Guide](developer_loop/dev-setup.md).

### New Branch Build Flow

Use this when you create a new branch and want `revyl dev` to run that branch's build:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-login
revyl build --platform ios-dev          # or android-dev
revyl dev --platform ios
```

If you need to pin exactly one build:

```bash
revyl dev --build-version-id <build-id>
```

### New Branch Direct File Flow (No Build Step)

Use this when you already have a local artifact and want to upload it without running the build command.

1. Build the artifact with your normal local or CI build command.
2. Upload it with `revyl build upload --file`.
3. Run `revyl dev`.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-login
revyl build upload --file build/dev-ios.tar.gz --platform ios
revyl dev --platform ios
```

Optional explicit version label:

```bash
revyl build upload --file build/dev-ios.tar.gz --platform ios --version feature-new-login-20260227-153000
```

Dev test helpers (pass `--context` to reuse a running dev loop's relay):

```bash
revyl dev test run login-flow                     # starts own Metro + relay
revyl dev test run login-flow --context ios-main   # reuses running dev loop's relay
revyl dev test open login-flow
revyl dev test create new-flow --platform ios
```

Plain device sessions (no hot reload -- these are the base layer `revyl dev` builds on):

```bash
revyl device start --platform ios
# Want hot reload? Run: revyl dev attach active
```

Multiple sessions and batched actions (recommended for coding agents -- one
invocation instead of many, compact JSON output):

```bash
revyl device start --platform ios,android --label checkout-ios,checkout-droid --json
revyl device start --platform ios --count 2 --json # two iOS sessions in parallel
revyl device label 0 logged-in                     # label a running session
revyl device list --json                           # indices, labels, state

revyl device batch --steps '[
  {"action":"tap","s":"checkout-ios","target":"Sign In"},
  {"action":"type","s":"checkout-ios","target":"email field","text":"user@example.com"},
  {"action":"screenshot","s":"checkout-droid","out":"android.png"}
]'
```

Each batch step is one action (`tap`, `type`, `swipe`, `key`, `wait`,
`screenshot`, `hierarchy`, ...) and may set `"s"` to route to a session by
index or label. Labels work anywhere `-s` takes an index (`-s checkout-ios`,
`device use checkout-ios`). When more than one session is active, batch steps
must address their session explicitly — implicit active-session routing is
refused — and bare device commands warn which session they targeted. Output
is one compact JSON line per step (echoing the resolved session) plus a
summary. See `revyl device batch --help` for the full action list.

### Builds and Dev Mode

All `revyl build` and `revyl build upload` commands push to a shared app container (the `app_id` in your config). Each upload is tagged with your git branch and commit via metadata.

When you run `revyl dev`, the CLI scans the app container for a build matching your current git branch. If found, it uses that build. If not, it falls back to the latest available build and prints a warning.

Each developer gets their own cloud device session, relay, and local dev server -- builds are the only shared resource.

**When you need a new build (by project type):**

- **Expo / React Native**: Dev mode serves your JS/TS live from your local Metro via a Revyl relay. The binary is just a "dev client shell." You only need a new build when native dependencies change (new native modules, Podfile changes, Gradle dependency changes, `app.json` native config).
- **Swift** (coming soon): Every code change requires a new build. The binary *is* the app.
- **Kotlin/Android** (coming soon): Every code change requires a new build.

**Team workflow commands:**

```bash
revyl build list --branch HEAD               # Does my branch have a build?
revyl build --platform ios-dev               # Build/upload tagged with current branch
revyl dev                                     # Auto-picks branch-matched build
revyl dev --build-version-id <id>            # Pin a specific build
```

**Tip**: For Expo/React Native, multiple developers can use the same dev build and still see their own code changes, since JS is served locally. For native projects, each developer should upload their own branch build.

## App Management

An **app** is a named container for your uploaded builds (e.g. "My App Android"). Tests run against an app.

```bash
revyl app create --name "My App" --platform android   # Create an app
revyl app list                                         # List all apps
revyl app list --platform ios                          # Filter by platform
revyl app delete "My App"                              # Delete an app
```

## Build Management

```bash
revyl build                              # Build from config and upload
revyl build --platform android           # Build a specific config platform
revyl build upload --file ./app.apk --app <id>  # Upload a local artifact directly
revyl build upload --url <artifact-url> --app <id>  # Ingest from a remote URL
revyl build list                         # List uploaded builds
revyl build list --app <app-id>          # List builds for a specific app
```

### Uploading a Build

Use `revyl build` any time you want to refresh the binary on Revyl without re-running tests.

Common flow:

1. Make sure your app is configured and credentials are available.
2. Run:

```bash
cd your-app
revyl build --platform ios        # or --platform android
```

When `--version` is omitted, the CLI defaults to a branch-aware version label:
`<branch-slug>-<timestamp>` (for example `feature-new-login-20260227-153000`).
In detached-head/non-git contexts it falls back to timestamp-only.

3. Use the uploaded binary by running tests against the latest upload:

```bash
revyl test run login-flow
```

Or let Revyl handle build + upload automatically:

```bash
revyl test run login-flow --build
```

Useful companion commands:

- `revyl build list` to verify uploads and inspect platform/app history
- `revyl test run <test> --build-id <id>` to pin a specific build

For Expo projects, `revyl build` performs an EAS auth preflight first.
If EAS login is missing, the CLI prompts to run `npx --yes eas-cli login` (interactive TTY only), or prints the exact fix command in non-interactive environments.

### Uploading from a URL

For teams that store builds in internal artifact storage (Artifactory, S3, GCS, GitHub Actions),
the CLI can ingest an artifact directly from a URL without downloading it locally first:

```bash
# Public or pre-signed URL
revyl build upload --url https://artifacts.internal.company.com/builds/app-latest.ipa --app <id>

# Authenticated URL with custom headers
revyl build upload --url https://example.com/builds/app.apk \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  --app <id>

# Multiple headers
revyl build upload --url https://example.com/builds/app.ipa \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  --header "X-Custom-Header: value" \
  --app <id>
```

The backend downloads, validates, and stores the artifact server-side. The
`--url` flag is mutually exclusive with `--file`.

### Native iOS: Build in Xcode, then `revyl dev`

For native iOS developers, `revyl dev` automatically detects the most recent
simulator `.app` from Xcode DerivedData. Build your app in Xcode as you
normally would, then run:

```bash
revyl dev                     # Auto-finds and uploads the local simulator build
revyl dev --build             # Force a rebuild from the configured build command
revyl dev --build-version-id <id>  # Pin a specific uploaded build
```

The discovery scans `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/<Project>-*/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/*.app`
for the most recently modified non-test `.app` that matches the project in the
current directory. Test runner bundles (`*Tests.app`, `*UITests.app`) are
automatically excluded.

## Test Management

For the end-to-end CLI authoring workflow, see [Creating Tests](tests/creating-tests.md).

```bash
# Test lifecycle
revyl test create login-flow --platform android   # Create + auto-sync YAML to .revyl/tests/
revyl test create --from-session <session-id> login-flow --app <app-id>
revyl test run login-flow                          # Run a test
revyl test open login-flow                         # Open test in browser editor
revyl test rename login-flow new-login-flow        # Rename while preserving history
revyl test duplicate login-flow                    # Clone an existing test
revyl test delete login-flow                       # Delete a test
revyl test cancel <task-id>                        # Cancel a running test

# Sync & inspect
revyl sync                        # Reconcile tests, workflows, and app links
revyl sync --dry-run              # Preview reconciliation changes
revyl sync --tests --prune        # Reconcile tests and prune stale mappings
revyl test list                   # Show local tests with sync status
revyl test remote                 # List all tests in your organization
revyl test push                   # Push local changes to remote
revyl test pull                   # Pull remote changes to local
revyl test diff login-flow        # Show diff between local and remote

# Execution status & reports
revyl test status login-flow                       # Latest execution status
revyl test history login-flow                      # Execution history (table)
revyl test report login-flow                       # Detailed report (latest execution)
revyl test report <task-uuid> --json               # Report by task ID, JSON output
revyl test report login-flow --no-steps            # Summary only, no step breakdown
revyl test share login-flow                        # Generate shareable report link
revyl test share login-flow --open                 # Share link and open in browser

# Versioning
revyl test versions login-flow                     # Show saved versions for a test
revyl test restore login-flow                      # Restore to a previous version

# YAML-first bootstrap (no existing .revyl/config.yaml required)
revyl test create login-flow --from-file ./login-flow.yaml
revyl test create --from-session <session-id> login-flow --app <app-id>
revyl test push login-flow --force

# Per-command flags
#   --dry-run    Available on: test create, test push, test pull

# Dev loop shortcuts (use revyl dev for hot reload)
revyl dev
revyl dev test run login-flow
```

### Test Variables

Per-test variables referenced in step descriptions via `{{name}}` syntax and substituted at runtime. Names may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores.

```bash
revyl test var list login-flow                              # List variables on a test
revyl test var get login-flow username                      # Read a single value
revyl test var set login-flow username=testuser@example.com # Add or update (upsert)
revyl test var set login-flow "password=my secret"          # Values may contain spaces
revyl test var set login-flow otp-code                      # Name-only (runtime-filled)
revyl test var rename login-flow old-name new-name          # Preserve value, change name
revyl test var delete login-flow username                   # Delete one
revyl test var clear login-flow                             # Delete ALL (needs --force in non-TTY)
```

Test variables are distinct from [Global Variables](#global-variables) (org-wide `{{global.name}}`) and [Global Launch Variables](#global-launch-variables) (org-wide reusable launch env vars).

## Tags

Organize tests with tags for filtering and grouping.

```bash
revyl tag list                                # List all tags with test counts
revyl tag list --search regression            # Filter by name
revyl tag create regression --color "#22C55E" # Create (color optional, hex)
revyl tag update regression --name regression-v2 --description "…"
revyl tag delete regression --force           # Delete (removes from all tests)

# Tag assignments on a test
revyl tag get my-test                         # Show tags on a test
revyl tag set my-test regression,smoke        # Replace all tags (auto-creates missing)
revyl tag add my-test login                   # Add tags (keep existing)
revyl tag remove my-test smoke                # Remove specific tags
```

## Module Management

Reusable modules can be imported into tests with `module_import` blocks. For examples, see [Creating Tests](tests/creating-tests.md#reusable-modules).

```bash
revyl module list                                  # List modules
revyl module list --search login                   # Filter modules by name/description
revyl module get login                             # Show module blocks and metadata
revyl module create login-flow --from-file blocks.yaml
revyl module update login --from-file new-blocks.yaml
revyl module insert login                          # Print a module_import YAML snippet
revyl module usage login                           # Show tests that import this module
revyl module versions login                        # List saved versions (who changed what and when)
revyl module restore login --version 2             # Restore blocks + metadata to a prior version
revyl module delete login                          # Delete a module
```

## Scripts

Manage code-execution scripts used by `code_execution` blocks in tests. Supported runtimes: `python`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `bash`.

```bash
revyl script list                                             # List all scripts
revyl script list --runtime python                            # Filter by runtime
revyl script list --json                                      # JSON output
revyl script get my-validator                                 # Show metadata + source
revyl script create my-validator --runtime python --file validate.py
revyl script create price-check --runtime javascript --file check.js --description "Validate prices"
revyl script update my-validator --file validate.py           # Replace source
revyl script update my-validator --name new-name              # Rename
revyl script update my-validator --description "Updated"      # Change description
revyl script delete my-validator --force                      # Delete
revyl script usage my-validator                               # Show tests that use this script
revyl script insert my-validator                              # Print a code_execution YAML snippet
```

## File Management

Manage files (certificates, configs, images, media) in your organization's file library. Tests reference uploaded files via `revyl-file://` URIs.

```bash
revyl file list                                               # List files
revyl file list --limit 10 --offset 20                        # Paginate
revyl file upload ./certs/staging.pem                         # Upload a file

## Global Resources

Org-wide resources available across all tests.

### Global Variables

Shared variables referenced via `{{global.name}}`. Local test variables with the same name take precedence. Use `--secret` for credentials or tokens; secret values are encrypted and shown as `********` in list/get output.

```bash
revyl global var list                                         # List all
revyl global var get login-email                              # Read one (secrets are masked)
revyl global var set login-email=testuser@example.com         # Add or update (upsert)
revyl global var set "password=my secret" --secret            # Store as encrypted secret
revyl global var set "password=new value" --no-secret         # Convert/update as plaintext
revyl global var set otp-code                                 # Name-only (runtime-filled)
revyl global var delete login-email                           # Delete
```

### Global Launch Variables

Reusable launch variables stored at the org level and attached to tests from the web UI. Use these for shared environment config (API URLs, feature flags) passed at app launch.

Getting started with raw device sessions:

```bash
revyl global launch-var create API_URL=https://staging.example.com
revyl device start --platform ios --launch-var API_URL
```

Create the org launch variable first with a `KEY=VALUE` pair, then pass that key (or the launch variable UUID) to `revyl device start --launch-var` when booting a raw session. Repeat `--launch-var` to apply multiple launch vars.

```bash
revyl global launch-var list                                  # List (values masked)
revyl global launch-var list --show-values                    # Unmask values
revyl global launch-var get API_URL                           # Show one
revyl global launch-var create API_URL=https://staging.example.com
revyl global launch-var create DEBUG=true --description "Enable debug startup"
revyl global launch-var update API_URL --value https://prod.example.com
revyl global launch-var update API_URL --key API_BASE_URL --description "Shared API endpoint"
revyl global launch-var delete API_URL --force                # Also detaches from any tests
```

Aliases: `launch-var`, `launch-vars`, `launch-variable`.

## Workflow Management

```bash
# Lifecycle
revyl workflow list                                              # List all workflows
revyl workflow list --json                                       # JSON output
revyl workflow info smoke-tests                                  # Tests, overrides, run config, last run
revyl workflow create smoke-tests --tests login-flow,checkout    # Create workflow
revyl workflow add-tests smoke-tests payment                     # Add test(s) to workflow
revyl workflow remove-tests smoke-tests checkout                 # Remove test(s) from workflow
revyl workflow rename smoke-tests regression-smoke               # Rename (preserves history)
revyl workflow run smoke-tests                                   # Run workflow
revyl workflow run smoke-tests --build                           # Build + upload before running
revyl workflow run smoke-tests --ios-app <uuid> --android-app <uuid>  # Override apps for this run
revyl workflow run smoke-tests --location "37.7749,-122.4194"    # Override GPS for this run
revyl workflow open smoke-tests                                  # Open in browser
revyl workflow delete smoke-tests                                # Delete workflow
revyl workflow cancel <task-id>                                  # Cancel running workflow

# Execution status & reports
revyl workflow status smoke-tests                                # Latest execution status
revyl workflow history smoke-tests                               # Execution history (table)
revyl workflow report smoke-tests                                # Detailed report (latest)
revyl workflow report <task-uuid> --json                         # Report by task ID, JSON
revyl workflow share smoke-tests                                 # Generate shareable link
revyl workflow share smoke-tests --open                          # Share and open in browser
```

### Workflow Settings

Stored overrides and run configuration that apply to every execution of a workflow.

```bash
# Location override (all tests in workflow use this GPS)
revyl workflow location set my-workflow --lat 37.7749 --lng -122.4194
revyl workflow location show my-workflow
revyl workflow location clear my-workflow

# App override (per platform)
revyl workflow app set my-workflow --ios <app-uuid>
revyl workflow app set my-workflow --android <app-uuid>
revyl workflow app set my-workflow --ios <ios-uuid> --android <android-uuid>
revyl workflow app show my-workflow
revyl workflow app clear my-workflow

# Run config (parallelism, retries)
revyl workflow config show my-workflow
revyl workflow config set my-workflow --parallel 3 --retries 2
```

### Workflow Quarantine

Quarantined tests still run but their failures are ignored when computing overall workflow pass/fail — useful for unblocking CI while flaky tests are investigated.

```bash
revyl workflow quarantine list smoke-tests                             # Show tests and status
revyl workflow quarantine add smoke-tests login-flow                   # Quarantine one
revyl workflow quarantine add smoke-tests login-flow checkout payment  # Quarantine several
revyl workflow quarantine remove smoke-tests login-flow                # Unquarantine
```

## GitHub PR Automation

Connect the Revyl GitHub App and manage PR automation (`pr_review` in `.revyl/config.yaml`) without leaving the terminal.

```bash
revyl github setup                       # Connect, scaffold pr_review, and push it (one-shot)
revyl github connect                     # Install the Revyl GitHub App in your browser
revyl github status                      # Show connection status + repo access
revyl github init                        # Scaffold a pr_review block from the detected build
revyl github init --framework expo_ios   # Force a build framework when scaffolding
revyl github push                        # Apply .revyl/config.yaml now (no commit required)
revyl github push --repo owner/name      # Target a specific repository
```

- `revyl github connect` opens the GitHub App install page in your browser, then waits and confirms once the install is active. It's a no-op if already connected.
- `revyl github push` applies your local config immediately (no commit/merge needed). If no `pr_review` section exists yet, it scaffolds one from the detected build first.
- The repo's settings page updates automatically once a push lands.

See the [GitHub integration](https://docs.revyl.ai/integrations/github) for the full `pr_review` schema.

For raw device sessions, URL-based app flows work in two modes:
- `revyl device start --app-url ...` preinstalls the app before the session is ready.
- To inject launch config at boot, first create an org launch variable with `revyl global launch-var create KEY=VALUE`, then pass the key with `revyl device start --launch-var KEY`.
- `revyl device install --app-url ...` installs into an already running raw session.
- `revyl device download-file --url ...` only downloads the file to device storage; it does not install the app.

### Live Stream URL

Every active session streams the device screen over WebRTC. The `--json` output from `device info` and `device list` includes a `whep_url` field — a standard [WHEP](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-murillo-whep-03.html) playback URL you can embed in your own platform or feed into any WHEP-compatible player.

```bash
# Get the raw stream URL for the active session
revyl device info --json | jq -r '.whep_url'

# List all sessions with their stream URLs
revyl device list --json | jq '.[].whep_url'
```

The stream becomes available shortly after session start. See [SDK > Live Streaming](device-sdk/reference.md#live-streaming) for programmatic usage.

### Device Session Flags

```bash
-s <index>        # Target a specific session (default: active)
--json            # Output as JSON (useful for scripting)
--timeout <secs>  # Idle timeout for start (default: 300)
```
